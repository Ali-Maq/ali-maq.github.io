## Overview

Carcrew was an automotive marketplace platform where I served as **Technical Lead** on the founding team, contributing to technical due diligence that secured **$2M Series A funding** from TVS Group.

## The Problem

Used car marketplaces in India faced challenges:
- **Trust deficit**: Buyers couldn't verify vehicle condition
- **Fragmented market**: No unified platform for quality listings
- **Transaction friction**: Complex paperwork and financing

## Technical Approach

### Platform Architecture
Built MVP using:
- **Django**: Core web application framework
- **Flask**: Microservices for specific features
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for transactions

### Key Features
- Vehicle listing and search
- Condition verification workflow
- User authentication and profiles
- Transaction management

## Results

| Metric | Achievement |
|--------|-------------|
| Daily Active Users | **10,000+** |
| Series A Funding | **$2M** (TVS Group) |
| Technical Role | Founding team, Due diligence contributor |
| Duration | Aug 2016 - Sep 2017 |

## Technical Due Diligence

Contributed to investor evaluation by:
- Demonstrating scalable architecture
- Presenting technical roadmap
- Explaining platform security measures

## Technical Stack

```
Backend:        Django, Flask
Database:       PostgreSQL
Infrastructure: AWS
Languages:      Python, JavaScript
```

## Career Significance

Carcrew was my first major technical leadership role, setting the foundation for later work in production systems at Mount Sinai. Key learnings:

- **Startup engineering**: Building MVPs under resource constraints
- **Investor relations**: Communicating technical value to non-technical stakeholders
- **Scale planning**: Designing systems that can grow with user demand

The experience of building a production system used by 10,000+ daily users directly informed my approach to clinical AI systems where reliability and user trust are paramount.
