## Graduate Research Mentorship

### Carnegie Mellon University Capstone Project
**Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai** | Sep 2024 - Dec 2024

Mentored 6 Carnegie Mellon University graduate students on a CAR-T therapy monitoring capstone project focused on early detection of Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS).

**Project Scope:**
- Guided experiment design, baselining, and reporting for CRS prediction using wearable data and cytokine biomarkers
- Students developed ML models using time-lagged features from wearable devices (skin temperature, SpO2) and 92-biomarker Olink panel
- Evaluated 5 classifiers (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVM, Logistic Regression, k-NN) via StratifiedKFold CV
- Final models achieved **84.62% accuracy** for ide-cel and **80.62%** for cilta-cel within a 6-hour prediction window
- Coordinated with clinical team on project scope, data access, IRB compliance, and deliverables

**Skills Developed by Students:**
- Clinical ML pipeline development
- Time-series feature engineering from wearable data
- Biomarker analysis and SHAP interpretation
- Healthcare data handling and HIPAA compliance
