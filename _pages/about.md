I've always been drawn to building things that matter. After finishing my Computer Science degree in India, I joined **Carcrew** as Technical Lead—a scrappy automotive startup where I learned what it takes to ship products that real people use. I built the product and team from scratch—learning what it takes to ship fast and iterate faster. It was exhilarating, but something kept nagging at me: I wanted to go deeper.

That pull brought me to **NYU Tandon** for my MS in Computer Engineering, where everything changed. Working with **Prof. Dennis Shasha**, **Prof. Manpreet Katari**, and **Prof. Parijat Dube** (IBM Research) opened my eyes to the beauty of deep learning—not just as a tool, but as a way of thinking about problems. As an **Entrepreneurial Fellow**, I conceptualized and built **AYA**, an EdTech startup that got selected for NYU's Entrepreneurial Sprint (10 of 150). I published my first paper at **ACL 2023 (BEA Workshop)** on detecting AI-generated text. Graduated with Honors. But more importantly, I found my calling: using AI to solve problems where the stakes are real.

Now I'm at **Mount Sinai**, building AI systems for precision oncology. The work is hard—when a clinician uses your tool to make treatment decisions, there's no margin for error. I've built multi-agent systems that extract genomic evidence (**OncoCITE**: 97.8% precision, submitted to Nature Cancer), GPU pipelines that turned week-long workflows into 3-hour runs (92.3% time reduction), and fine-tuned voice ASR for clinical terminology. Research includes a widely cited clinical RAG framework (**35+ citations**) and first-author work at **ACL (BEA Workshop)**.

Outside of work, I'm focused on two things: **open source** and **interpretability**. I've built a lot of tools that stayed locked in production—this year I'm changing that. This site is where I'll document what I've learned and release projects for others to use and improve. I'm also deep in the weeds of **model interpretability**, participating in **SPAR** and other AI safety programs. After years of making models work, I want to understand *why* they work—and when they don't.

If you're curious about multi-agent systems, clinical AI, or interpretability—I'd love to connect. The best ideas come from unexpected conversations.
