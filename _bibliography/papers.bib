  author={Quidwai, Mujahid Ali and Thibaud, Santiago and Jagannath, Sundar and Parekh, Samir and Lagana, Alessandro},
  abstract={We present OncoCITE, a multi-agent AI system for automated genomic evidence extraction from scientific literature. Through systematic exploratory data analysis on the CIViC database (11,312 evidence items, 3,083 publications), we quantified 12 structural bottlenecks including curation latency (median 31 days, P90 >21 months) and emerging target gaps. Our 6-agent architecture using Claude Agent SDK with 22 MCP tools achieves 84% ground truth recovery, 97.8% novel discovery precision, and 0% critical errors on a 15-paper validation corpus. A novel three-way validation framework identified 24.2% curation errors in expert-curated databases.},

  author={Quidwai, Mujahid Ali and Lagana, Alessandro},
  abstract={We developed a production Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for clinical decision support in multiple myeloma. The system uses LangGraph orchestration, BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5 embeddings for semantic retrieval, and Mistral-7B for generation. Processing 5,000+ clinical documents, we achieved 88% clinical effectiveness. The first prototype was deployed and actively used by 2-3 clinicians at Mount Sinai for multiple myeloma research and treatment planning, demonstrating the feasibility of production RAG systems in healthcare settings.},

  author={Quidwai, Mujahid Ali and Li, Chunhui and Dube, Parijat},
  abstract={We present a novel multi-faceted NLP approach for detecting AI-generated text in educational settings. Our method employs contrastive loss training and LLM-generated paraphrases to achieve 94% accuracy in human-AI text classification. Unlike black-box approaches, our system provides interpretable signals at both sentence and document levels, enabling educators to understand the nature and extent of AI involvement in student submissions. This work was conducted in collaboration with IBM Research.},

  author={Rajeeve, Sridevi and Wilkes, Matt and Zahradka, Nicole and Tomalin, Lewis E. and Quidwai, Mujahid Ali and Pan, David and Chari, Ajai and Jagannath, Sundar and Parekh, Samir and Lagana, Alessandro},
  abstract={We developed a machine learning system for early prediction of Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) in CAR-T therapy patients from an investigator-initiated trial (N=25 patients). We engineered time-lagged features from continuous wearable data (skin temperature, SpO2, heart rate) and a 92-biomarker Olink panel. Evaluating 5 classifiers via StratifiedKFold CV, we achieved 84.62% accuracy for ide-cel and 80.62% for cilta-cel within a 6-hour prediction window. SHAP analysis identified IFN-γ as a cross-product predictor, and a fold-change classifier achieved 90% precision with 40-hour mean lead time before CRS onset.},

  abstract={We developed the PRIME (Predictive Relapse Indicators for Myeloma T-Cell Engagers) model for patients receiving BCMA- and GPRC5D-targeting T-cell engager therapies including teclistamab, elranatamab, and talquetamab. By integrating clinical, genomic, and treatment response data, we identified early relapse indicators enabling risk stratification at treatment initiation and monitoring strategy optimization. The model supports clinical decision-making for the growing landscape of bispecific antibody therapies in multiple myeloma.},
